<!--
    This is the State Manager Component that is placed on the
    target Razor page and is referenced by a page instance variable.

    The component exposes the PageState parameter (required) and the
    PageStateChanged callback. It accepts one RenderFragment for each
    of the page states which are passed into the PageStateContainer component below.

    Remember, the only thing produced by the PageStateManager is a single
    RenderFragment--the one associated with the current page state.
